        "*   Its significant to provide a way to treat objects as if they were functions, enhancing flexibility and supporting functional programming patterns in OOP.\n",
        "*   It enhances abstraction and polymorphism by allowing objects to mimic function behavior.\n",
        "*   Its used commonly in frameworks for machine learning models, decorators, where objects need to act like functions while maintaining state.\n",
